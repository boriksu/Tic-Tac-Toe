# Tic-Tac-Toe
Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

Suppose the bottom left cell has the coordinates (1, 1) and the top right cell has the coordinates (3, 3) like in this table:

(1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)
(1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)
(1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)

The program should ask to enter the coordinates where a user wants to make a move.
The first one of you moves as X, and then the other one moves as O.
